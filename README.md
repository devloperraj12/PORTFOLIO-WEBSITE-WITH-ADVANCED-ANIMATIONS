*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
*NAME*: RAJ KUMAR SAH

*DOMAIN*: FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT 
*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS
*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

**As part of the internship at CodTech, I was assigned the task of designing and developing a personal portfolio website using modern CSS animations and advanced frontend libraries like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The goal was to create a visually appealing, responsive, and animated portfolio site that showcases my technical skills and academic background in a structured and interactive way. 

Tools and Technologies Used:
HTML: Used to structure the webpage with proper sections like About Me, Skills, and Contact.
CSS: Applied for styling the layout, colors, and background animations. I added hover effects and rounded cards to make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Included for animation effects and interactive transitions.
GSAP Library: Used to animate text and section elements when the page loads, making it feel modern and professional.
GitHub: I used GitHub to store and share the project, which is helpful for version control and showing my work to others.

Key Features of My Website:
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts based on screen size, which means it works well on mobile phones too.
Animated Sections: With GSAP, the header, profile section, and content cards animate as the page loads.
LinkedIn Icon: Instead of displaying my full LinkedIn profile, I added a simple icon that links to my profile, making it safer and professional.
Simple and Clean Design: I used soft colors, basic fonts, and card-style sections so that the website looks attractive but not complicated.

Why This Task Is Useful:
This portfolio website can be shared with interviewers, teachers, or recruiters to show what I know about web development. It also helps me understand how real-world websites are builtâ€”from writing HTML to adding animations. I learned how to use a JavaScript library (GSAP) and improved my design skills too. This kind of website is great for personal branding and can also be used for freelance work or online resumes in the future.
Overall, I enjoyed working on this task and gained good experience in frontend development.
